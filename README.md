Question Answering System Based on HOTPOTQA Dataset

Author: Jiaming Li

### Dateset: HOTPOTQA
HOTPOTQA is a dataset which contains 113k Wikipedia-based question-answer pairs with four key features. These are questions that require finding and reasoning over multiple supporting documents to answer, the questions are diverse and not constrained to any pre-existing knowledge bases or knowledge schemas, sentence-level supporting facts required for reasoning, allowing QA systems to reason with strong supervision and explain predictions and a new type of factoid comparison questions to test QA systemsâ€™ ability to extract relevant facts and perform necessary comparison. </br>
